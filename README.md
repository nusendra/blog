# sapper-blog-template

A starter template for building markdown-powered blogs with [Sapper](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper) and [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte).

### 👉 [Demo](https://sapper-blog-template.netlify.com/)

## ✨ Getting started

```bash
npx degit Charca/sapper-blog-template my-blog
cd my-blog
npm install # or yarn!
npm run dev
```

Open up [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and start clicking around.

Consult [sapper.svelte.dev](https://sapper.svelte.dev) for help getting started.

## 🏗 Structure

The base structure of this template is the same as Sapper's [default template](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper-template/). These are some of the new things you'll find here:

### src/routes/blog

This is the home of your blog. The most important files in here are:

- `_posts.js`: this module contains the logic for loading and parsing your markdown posts.
- `[slug].svelte`: this is the template of your blog post page.
- `index.svelte`: this is the template of your article list page.

### src/routes/blog/posts

This is where your markdown posts live in. All `.md` files in this directory are treated as blog posts and parsed automatically by the `_posts.js` module.

- The markdown file name becomes the post slug. For example `hello-world.md` becomes `http://localhost:3000/blog/hello-world`.
- Everything between the start of the post and the `<!-- more -->` tag becomes the article's "excerpt".
- Frontmatter properties supported are `title` and `date`.
